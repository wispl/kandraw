# KanDraw

Stupid Simple Structured webnotes with text and drawing. Mainly for me.

## Features

* Growable textarea
* Handdrawing

#### Todo

- Investigate inserting without using modals
- More field manipulation
- More field types
- Colors for canvas
- Scalable drawing field
- Better way of creating a PDF (Printing it and saving to PDF is not elegant nor reliable)
